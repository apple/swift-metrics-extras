# SSM-0002: Rename `swift-metrics-extras` to better reflect its purpose

Rename the package and repository from `swift-metrics-extras` to `swift-system-metrics` to better reflect its single, focused purpose.

### Introduction

Rename the `swift-metrics-extras` package and repository to `swift-system-metrics` to accurately represent its purpose.

### Motivation

The package name `swift-metrics-extras` suggests a collection of various metrics-related utilities, but the package contains only one component collecting and reporting process system metrics. This creates confusion for potential users and does not accurately describe the package's purpose. A more descriptive name would make it easier for users to discover and understand what the package does.

### Proposed solution

Rename the package and repository from `swift-metrics-extras` to `swift-system-metrics`. This name directly describes the package's single responsibility: collecting system metrics.

### Detailed design

- Rename the GitHub repository from `apple/swift-metrics-extras` to `apple/swift-system-metrics` (GitHub automatically sets up redirects from the old repository URL to the new one).
- Update the package name in `Package.swift`.
- Update all documentation references to reflect the new name.
- Update Swift Package Index [entry](https://github.com/SwiftPackageIndex/PackageList/blob/main/packages.json#L637).

### API stability

This change does not affect the API surface at all. Users do not need to update their `Package.swift` dependencies to the new repository URL immediately.

### Future directions

None specific to this proposal.

### Alternatives considered

**Keep the current name.** This would maintain continuity but perpetuate the confusion about the package's scope and purpose, potentially inviting PRs with random functionality.
**Use `swift-process-metrics`.** While more specific, `swift-system-metrics` gives more freedom in the scope of collected metrics, not limiting them to just process metrics.
